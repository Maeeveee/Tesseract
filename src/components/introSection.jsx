                    I’ve been creating projects with React, Tailwind, Vite, and Supabase, while also exploring Docker, n8n, and APIs. From simple portfolio websites and small games like Splendor to full-stack catalog apps for real businesses, I enjoy turning ideas into something real.
                    Always curious about new frontend and backend technologies, I’m passionate about learning and making better products every day </p>
